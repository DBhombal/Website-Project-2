# Website-Project-2
The Final project to the second-level web development course at my university. In this one, I made use of MVC architecture to create a sort of forum website. It is in php and uses mySQL for database use. It utilizes sessions, cookies, and user authentication. The website was run on a Linux-based host, which has been taken down after the course has concluded.
